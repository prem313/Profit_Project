## Introduction

Predicting the profit of a startup is crucial for making informed business decisions. This project utilizes linear regression, a popular machine learning algorithm, to predict the profit of startups based on their R&D Spend, Administration, and Marketing Spend.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/startup-profit-prediction.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd startup-profit-prediction`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset (see [Dataset](#dataset) section for details).
2. Train the linear regression model (see [Model Training](#model-training) section for details).
3. Use the trained model to predict startup profits (see [Prediction](#prediction) section for details).

Example commands:
- To preprocess the dataset: `python preprocess.py --input data.csv --output preprocessed_data.csv`
- To train the model: `python train_model.py --input preprocessed_data.csv --model linear_model.pkl`
- To predict profits: `python predict.py --input preprocessed_data.csv --model linear_model.pkl`

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about various startups, including their R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, and Profit. The dataset is used to train and evaluate the linear regression model.

## Features

The features used for predicting startup profits are:
1. R&D Spend
2. Administration
3. Marketing Spend

You can explore and modify these features based on your specific use case.

## Model Training

The linear regression model is trained using the preprocessed dataset. The training script fits the model to the training data and saves it for future predictions.

## Prediction

After training the model, you can use it to predict the profit of new startups based on their R&D Spend, Administration, and Marketing Spend. The prediction script loads the trained model and generates profit predictions for the provided input data.
